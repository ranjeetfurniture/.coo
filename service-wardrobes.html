      <h2>Wardrobe Manufacturing & Installation</h2>
      <p>
        At RS Ranjeet Sharma, we execute custom wardrobes with a focus on durability, internal planning, and clean finishing.
        All wardrobes are manufactured on site using accurate measurements to ensure perfect fitting.
        We use high-quality boards, strong carcass construction, and reliable hardware for long-term performance.
        Internal layouts are planned based on daily usage and storage needs.
        Sliding and hinged systems are installed with precise alignment.
        Edge finishing and panel strength are checked at every stage.
        We strictly follow approved drawings without unnecessary changes.
        Each wardrobe is installed under direct site supervision.
        Our priority is functional wardrobes that perform reliably for years.
