<h3>Corporate Office Interior – Head Office Fit-Out</h3>
<p class="project-subtitle">Delhi NCR | 6500 sq.ft | Corporate Workspace</p>

<p>
This corporate office project represents our complete interior execution capability from structure to final handover. The project involved workstations, executive cabins, conference rooms, storage systems, reception counters, and service coordination across multiple departments.
</p>

<p>
Execution began with site marking, level checks, and service layout planning. Modular workstations and storage units were manufactured and assembled on site with strict dimensional accuracy. All furniture components were fixed with proper anchoring, leveling, and edge finishing to ensure long-term stability.
</p>

<p>
Special attention was given to circulation flow, cable routing, and power access within each workstation cluster. Electrical cut-outs, data ports, and ventilation clearances were integrated during installation to avoid rework and future maintenance issues.
</p>

<p>
Glass partitions, acoustic panels, and executive furniture were installed with precise alignment and sealing. Each zone was checked for ergonomics, accessibility, and functional usability before final polishing and cleaning.
</p>

<p>
The project was delivered within committed timelines with zero structural rework and minimum site disturbance. Final inspection and handover confirmed clean finishing, stable installation, and reliable daily performance suitable for long-term corporate operations.

<h3>Bars & Lounges</h3>
<p class="project-subtitle">Sohna | Bars</p>
<p class="project-subtitle">Delhi NCR | 2500 sq.ft | Bars & Lounges</p>

<p>
At RS Ranjeet Sharma, we specialize in execution of bar and lounge interiors with a strong focus on structural strength, operational efficiency, and long-term durability. Hospitality spaces require precision execution because furniture, counters, and finishes are subjected to continuous public use, moisture exposure, and heavy service loads.
</p>

<p>
Our work includes fabrication and installation of bar counters, back bar storage systems, seating arrangements, wall paneling, feature ceilings, service counters, and circulation layouts. Every element is executed based on approved drawings, service coordination, and exact site measurements to ensure perfect alignment and smooth operations.
</p>

<p>
Special care is taken in selecting moisture-resistant boards, reinforced frameworks, heat-resistant counter surfaces, and impact-resistant finishes. Electrical routing, lighting integration, ventilation clearance, and plumbing coordination are executed during installation to maintain clean finishing without visible service lines.
</p>

<p>
Our execution approach ensures that bar and lounge interiors remain visually appealing, structurally stable, and functionally efficient throughout years of continuous operation.

<h3>Studio Interior – Creative Production Workspace</h3>
<p class="project-subtitle">Noida |1800 sq.ft | Recording & Creative Studio</p>
<p>
This creative studio project was designed and executed to support professional recording, editing, and production operations within a compact floor area. The space includes a main recording room, sound control cabin, editing workspace, and reception lounge.
</p>

<p>
Custom wall paneling with acoustic backing improves sound clarity and reduces echo across working zones. Furniture systems were fabricated with vibration-controlled fixing to avoid noise generation during operation. Storage units and equipment racks were planned to maintain easy access without obstructing movement.
</p>

<p>
Lighting layout balances functional task lighting with ambient illumination to reduce eye strain during long working hours. Ventilation grills and service access panels were integrated discreetly into wall and ceiling finishes to preserve clean visual lines.
</p>
<p>
The final execution delivers a technically stable, acoustically controlled, and visually refined studio environment suitable for continuous professional use.
