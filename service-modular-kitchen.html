      <h2>Modular Furniture Execution</h2>
      <p>
        At RS Ranjeet Sharma, we specialize in on-site manufactured modular furniture built for strength, accuracy, and long-term use.
        We use high-quality boards, durable hardware, and precise measurements to ensure every unit fits perfectly.
        Our work focuses on structural stability, clean edge finishing, and smooth daily functionality.
        Moisture-resistant materials are selected based on site conditions to improve durability.
        All fittings are installed with proper alignment to avoid future maintenance issues.
        We follow approved drawings strictly without unnecessary design changes.
        Each unit is fabricated and installed under direct site supervision.
        Quality checks are done at every stage of execution.
        Our priority is furniture that performs reliably, not just looks good.
