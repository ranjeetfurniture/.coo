<h2>Hospitality Interior Execution Strength</h2>

<p>
At RS Ranjeet Sharma, we execute complete bar and lounge interiors with strict control over structure, finishing, and service coordination. Hospitality environments demand strong furniture, moisture resistance, accurate lighting integration, and high durability due to continuous public usage.
</p>

<p>
We handle bar counters, back bar storage, seating systems, wall paneling, feature ceilings, service counters, and circulation planning with precise sequencing. All fabrication and installation are executed on site under supervision to ensure perfect alignment and functional usability.
</p>

<p>
Special attention is given to load-bearing counters, waterproof materials, concealed wiring, ventilation clearances, and hygiene requirements. Our execution ensures smooth operations, visual impact, and long-term performance in demanding hospitality environments.

<h3>Premium Lounge Bar – Main Counter & Seating Zone</h3>
<p class="project-subtitle">Delhi NCR | Night Lounge Interior</p>

<p>
This premium lounge bar project involved execution of the main bar counter, bottle display units, high seating systems, and wall feature panels. The counter structure was designed for heavy daily load, moisture resistance, and continuous service operations.
</p>

Back bar storage and shelving were installed with reinforced framing and accurate leveling. Electrical points, lighting strips, and service cut-outs were integrated during fabrication to maintain clean finishing without surface wiring.
</p>

<p>
Seating zones were planned for smooth circulation and customer comfort. All furniture edges, joints, and finishes were executed with high-wear resistance materials to maintain appearance under heavy footfall.
</p>

<p>
The final execution delivered a visually strong bar environment with durable structure, efficient service flow, and reliable long-term performance.
