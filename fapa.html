      <h2>FAPA – Factory Assembly & Project Assistance</h2>
      <p>
        RS Ranjeet Sharma provides professional Factory Assembly & Project Assistance services for interior and furniture projects.
        We support clients, architects, and manufacturers by managing on-site assembly and execution coordination.
        Factory-made furniture and components are assembled accurately as per drawings.
        Our team ensures correct sequencing, alignment, and fixing of all elements.
        Site coordination with vendors, electricians, and service teams is handled efficiently.
        Quality checks are performed during assembly stages.
        Minor on-site adjustments are managed without affecting overall quality.
