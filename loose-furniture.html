      <h2>Loose Furniture Manufacturing</h2>
      <p>
        At RS Ranjeet Sharma, we manufacture loose furniture with a focus on strength, comfort, and long-term usability.
        All furniture pieces are fabricated with proper material selection and solid construction.
        Accuracy in dimensions is maintained to suit the intended space.
        Joinery and fixing methods are chosen based on load and daily usage.
        Finishing quality is monitored to achieve clean edges and smooth surfaces.
        Furniture is tested for stability before delivery.
        Polishing and surface treatments are done for durability.
        Designs are executed as approved without unnecessary changes.
        Our loose furniture delivers reliability along with refined appearance.
