  <p>
    At RS Ranjeet Sharma, modular furniture is not factory-showroom work.
    It is **measured on site, built with precision, and installed for real-life use**.
    Every unit we execute is meant to last, align perfectly, and function smoothly for years.

<!-- ================= HOW WE EXECUTE ================= -->
<section>
  <h2 class="gold">How We Execute Modular Furniture On Site</h2>
  <p>
    We work strictly on finalized drawings or client-approved layouts.
    Measurements are taken on site to avoid alignment issues, wall deviations,
    and finishing errors. Materials are selected as per specification,
    and every panel, shutter, and carcass is checked before installation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Execution is done step-by-step — carpentry, alignment, hardware fitting,
    shutter installation, and final finishing. No shortcuts. No temporary fixes.
    Our focus is durability, clean edges, and correct functionality.
