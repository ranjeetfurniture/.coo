      <h2>Ranjeet Sharma</h2>
      <h3>Founder & Lead Execution Head</h3>

      <p>
        I am Ranjeet Sharma, a furniture manufacturing and interior fit-out contractor with more than 20 years of hands-on site experience.
        My journey started directly on construction sites, learning carpentry, furniture fabrication, modular systems, and execution supervision from the ground level.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years, I have personally executed residential furniture, corporate offices, cafes, clinics, studios, bars and complete interior fit-outs across Delhi NCR and other cities.
        I do not provide design services — my focus is only on **accurate execution of approved drawings** with strong materials, clean finishing and long-term performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every project I handle is supervised personally. From measurement to installation, I ensure proper alignment, material quality and finishing discipline so that furniture works smoothly for years, not just looks good on the first day.

      <h2>What We Do</h2>

      <p>
        RS Ranjeet Sharma specializes in on-site manufactured furniture and complete interior fit-out execution.
        Our core strength is site control — accurate measurements, material handling, fabrication supervision and final installation quality.
      </p>

      <p>
        We execute modular kitchens, wardrobes, beds, TV units, office furniture, cafe furniture, clinic furniture, wall paneling, POP and false ceilings, loose furniture manufacturing and turnkey interior works.
        All work is carried out with strict supervision, approved drawings and quality checks at every stage.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe furniture should be structurally strong, function smoothly and maintain finishing quality for many years.
        That is why we focus more on **execution quality** than on marketing or show designs.
