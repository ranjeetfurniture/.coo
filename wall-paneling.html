      <h2>Wall Paneling & Feature Wall Execution</h2>
      <p>
        At RS Ranjeet Sharma, we execute wall paneling and feature walls with a strong focus on alignment, surface preparation, and long-term durability.
        All paneling work is carried out on site with accurate measurements to ensure perfect fitting.
        We follow approved drawings strictly without unnecessary changes.
        Material selection is done based on wall condition, usage, and fixing requirements.
        Proper framework and fixing methods are used to avoid warping or gaps.
        Joint spacing and edge finishing are carefully monitored.
        Coordination with lighting and electrical points is handled precisely.
        Each stage of work is supervised on site.
        The final result delivers a clean, strong, and well-finished wall surface.
