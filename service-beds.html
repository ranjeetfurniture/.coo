      <h2>Beds, TV Units & Sofa Manufacturing</h2>
      <p>
        At RS Ranjeet Sharma, we execute beds, TV units, and sofa frameworks with a focus on strength, comfort, and long-term usability.
        All furniture is manufactured on site using accurate measurements to ensure perfect fitting within the space.
        Bed structures are built with strong internal frames to support daily use.
        TV units are planned for cable management, ventilation, and clean alignment.
        Sofa frameworks are fabricated to provide proper support and comfort.
        High-quality boards, plywood, and hardware are selected based on usage requirements.
        Finishing quality and edge detailing are carefully maintained.
        All installations are carried out under direct site supervision.
        Our work prioritizes durability and function over temporary appearance.
