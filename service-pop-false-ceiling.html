      <h2>POP & False Ceiling Execution</h2>
      <p>
        At RS Ranjeet Sharma, we execute POP and false ceiling work with a strong focus on structural accuracy, level finishing, and long-term stability.
        All ceiling work is carried out on site with proper framework alignment and secure fixing.
        We follow approved drawings strictly without unnecessary design modifications.
        Material selection is done based on ceiling height, lighting requirements, and site conditions.
        Joint finishing and surface smoothness are carefully monitored.
        Proper spacing is maintained for lighting fixtures and service access.
        Our execution ensures crack resistance and clean edges.
        Each stage of work is supervised on site.
        The final result delivers a neat, durable, and well-finished ceiling system.
